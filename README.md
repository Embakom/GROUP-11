                                        DNS Security and Tunneling Detection Tool
Overview
The DNS Security and Tunneling Detection Tool is a Python-based network security application that monitors DNS traffic in real time or from packet capture (PCAP) files.

It detects and helps mitigate DNS-based attacks, including:

🔍DNS Tunneling – where attackers hide malicious traffic inside DNS queries.
🔍DNS Spoofing – where fake DNS responses redirect users to malicious sites.

This tool helps protect data integrity and confidentiality by identifying suspicious DNS activity and alerting the user.

Key Features:

📡 Real-Time DNS Monitoring – Capture DNS packets as they occur.
🔍 DNS Tunneling Detection – Identify unusually long or encoded domain queries that could indicate data exfiltration.
⚠️ DNS Spoofing Alerts – Detect mismatched or unexpected IP addresses in DNS responses.
📂 PCAP File Analysis – Load and analyze saved network captures.
🛡 Custom Blacklist Support – Flag domains from known malicious lists.
📊 Report Generation – Summarize suspicious activity in a readable format.

How It Works:

🔍Packet Capture – Uses scapy to sniff DNS traffic or read from PCAP files.

🔍Analysis Engine – Checks for:

🔍Excessively long domain names.

🔍High frequency of DNS requests to the same domain.

🔍Base64-like or suspiciously encoded queries.

🔍Unexpected DNS response IPs.

🔍Alerts – Logs or displays suspicious DNS events to the user.

🔍Mitigation – Optionally block malicious domains via firewall rules (advanced mode).

Requirements

Python 3.x

Libraries:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install scapy dnspython
(Optional) Wireshark or tcpdump for PCAP generation.

Usage

1. Real-Time Monitoring
bash
Copy
Edit
python dns_security_tool.py --interface eth0
2. Analyze a PCAP File
bash
Copy
Edit
python dns_security_tool.py --pcap suspicious_traffic.pcap
3. Use a Blacklist File
bash
Copy
Edit
python dns_security_tool.py --pcap suspicious_traffic.pcap --blacklist blacklist.txt

Limitations

DNS over HTTPS (DoH) traffic cannot be inspected without HTTPS interception.
Detection accuracy depends on the blacklist and analysis rules.
Real-time blocking requires admin privileges.
Future Improvements
Machine learning-based tunneling detection.
Automatic firewall rule integration.
Web dashboard for monitoring and visualization.
